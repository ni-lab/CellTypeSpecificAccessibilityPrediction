## CellTypeSpecificAccessibilityPrediction

This repository contains information and scripts to train and benchmark genomic deep learning models on their performance in cell-type specific regulatory regions. It makes use of pre-trained Enformer(link) and Sei(link) models, which can be downloaded from the linked sources. It also makes use of scripts from the Basenji(link) repository for training additional models to benchmark different training decisions.
