After installing [basenji](https://github.com/calico/basenji/tree/master) according to the instructions within the repository, the following scripts can be used to generate predictions for relevant datasets:
* `predict_enformer_test_sequences.sh` generates predictions for all sequences in the Enformer test data
* `predict_gtex_eqtls.sh` generates predictions for GTeX SuSie fine-mapped eQTL data (the dataset can be downloaded [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/dm-enformer/data/gtex_fine))
